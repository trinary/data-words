## data words

I think I read the phrase 'data words' describing Tufte's sparklines. It may have been from ET himself. The name is great, though, word-sized data visualization, wherever they need to be. Don't break text flow, read a chart like text, but with much more information. This is a project to make embeddable, style-able, event-friendly data words as web components.

There are already a lot of ways to get sparklines. What this also is, is a way for me to become acquiainted with Web Components and custom elements in HTML5. I like the idea that a semantic tag system of custom elements is the way we extend our markup and add new capabilities.

More to come.
