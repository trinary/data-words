## data words

I think I first read the phrase 'data words' describing Tufte's sparklines. It may have been from ET himself. It's a great name, though: word-sized data visualizations, wherever they need to be. Don't break text layout, read a chart inline with your prose, providing much more information than a list of values or a summary. This is a project to make embeddable, style-able, event-friendly data words as [web components](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/explainer/).

There are already a lot of ways to get sparklines. This project is also a way for me to become acquiainted with Web Components and custom elements in HTML5. I like the idea that a semantic system of custom elements is the way we extend our markup and add new capabilities.

More to come.
